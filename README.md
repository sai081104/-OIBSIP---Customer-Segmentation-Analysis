# 📊 OIBSIP - Customer Segmentation Analysis

> Level 1 Task - Data Analytics Internship at Oasis Infobyte

## 📝 Project Description

This project involves performing **Customer Segmentation** using unsupervised learning on an e-commerce dataset. The goal is to group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing and strategic decision-making.

---

## 📂 Dataset

A sample customer dataset was used containing:
- Customer ID  
- Age  
- Annual Income  
- Spending Score  
- Behavioral patterns

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Challenges

- **Data Cleaning & Exploration**: Removed missing values and duplicates  
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`  
- **Clustering with K-Means**: Applied Elbow Method to find optimal clusters  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Used PCA for 2D visualization  
- **Insights**: Interpreted segments to support business strategies

## 📈 Visualizations Included

- Elbow Method for optimal k  
- 2D PCA Cluster Scatter Plot  
- Pair plots and summary statistics  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with clustering algorithms  
- Improved skills in feature scaling and visualization  
- Learned how to interpret customer groups for business impact
